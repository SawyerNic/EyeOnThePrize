Trebek's Intellects: Eye On The Prize

Eye On The Prize is a 1-3 player game where contestants race to complete a "Simon Says" style sequence of shapes. The patterns are given by the virtual host "Simon" and contestants input their patterns on physical podiums with four seperate shape buttons on their physical podiums. The exhibit is based on classic gameshows where contestants have to be the first to press on a buzzer.
